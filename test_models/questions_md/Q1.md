### Q1

** The ordered execution of code can be altered by employing control statements such as

**for**, **while**, **do**=**while**, **if**=**else if**=**else**, and **switch**.

a)

i.

Use a **while** loop to substitute the for loop, expressed as

**for**(i=0;i*<*100;++i) printf("%d",i );.

Answer

**int**

i = 0;

**while** ( i *<* 100)

*{* p r i n t f (" %d" ,

i ) ;

i++; *}*

ii.

Explain how the **switch** statement operates, either through an example or a flow

chart.

Answer

**switch** ( expression )

*{*

**case** value1 :

*// code to be*

*executed*

*i f*

*expression*

*equals*

*value1*

**break** ;

**case** value2 :

*// code to be*

*executed*

*i f*

*expression*

*equals*

*value2*

**break** ;

*//*

*. .*

*// more cases*

*as needed*

**default** :

*// code to be*

*executed*

*i f*

*none of*

*the*

*cases match*

*}*

Here’s how the switch statement operates:

1.

The expression is evaluated once.

2.

The value of the expression is compared with each case value.

3.

If a match is found, the code block associated with that case is executed.

4.

The break statement is used to exit the switch statement. Without break, the

control would fall through to subsequent cases (this is called ”fall-through”).

5.

If no match is found, the default case (if present) is executed. The default

case is optional.

iii.

Describe, with an example, how to use an **if**=**else if**=**else** statement as a sub-

stitute for the code implemented using a **switch** statement.

Answer

**int** day = 3;

**i f**

( day == 1) *{* p r i n t f ("Monday" ) ; *}*

**else**

**i f**

( day == 2) *{* p r i n t f ("Tuesday" ) ;

*}*

**else**

**i f**

( day == 3) *{* p r i n t f ("Wednesday" ) ;

*}*

**else**

**i f**

( day == 4) *{* p r i n t f ("Thursday" ) ;

*}*

**else**

**i f**

( day == 5) *{* p r i n t f ("Friday" ) ;

*}*

**else** *{* p r i n t f ("Weekend" ) ;

*}*

In this example:

1.

The if statement checks if day is equal to 1, and if true, it prints ”Monday.”

2.

The else if statements provide additional conditions to check sequentially.

If any of these conditions are true, it skips the subsequent else if and else

blocks.

3.

The final else block acts as the default case, similar to the default case in

the switch statement. If none of the previous conditions is true, it prints

”Weekend.”

4.

This if-else if-else construct achieves the same branching logic as the original

switch statement. Each else if block serves as a case, and the final else block

acts as the default case.

b)

The *median* in a data set refers to the central value when the data is organized in

ascending order. Its interpretation varies based on the dataset’s size: if the number of

values is odd, the median is the middle value; if it’s even, the median is the average

of the two middle values.

If the dataset is represented as an array defined by **float** num[N];, write code snippet

to display the median, with N representing a positive integer.

Answer

**int** ar [N] = *{*5 , 10 , 15 , 20 ,

. .

0 , 35 , 40 , 45 ,

50*}*; *// Example data*

*set*

**int** temp ,

median ;

**for** ( **int**

i = 0;

i *<* N=1;

i++) *// // Sort*

*the*

*array*

*{*

**for** ( **int**

j = 0;

j *<* N=i =1; j++)

*{*

**i f**

( ar [ j ] *>* ar [ j +1])

*{*

temp = ar [ j ] ;

ar [ j ] = ar [ j +1];

ar [ j +1] = temp ;

*}*

*}*

*}*

**i f**

(N % 2 == 0) *// Find the median*

median = ( ar [N/2 = 1] + ar [N/2]) / 2;

**else**

median = ar [N/ 2 ] ;
